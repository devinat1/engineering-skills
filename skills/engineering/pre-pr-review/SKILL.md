# Pre-PR review (repo-specific)

You are doing a final pre-PR check on changes about to be opened as a
pull request. The checklist part of this skill covers **repo-specific
invariants only**. Generic code-quality review (clarity, naming,
duplication, error handling, etc.) is the job of the
`thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` skill. Complexity-only review is the
job of the `ponytail-review` skill. After this checklist report is
complete, **immediately run** `ponytail-review` on the same branch changes,
then **immediately drive** the `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` skill
on those changes **in a loop until it comes back clean** — see § Run the
complexity review and § Loop the maintainability audit. After the
thermo-nuclear output, run the `confounder` skill on claims expressed by
the branch changes — see § Audit changed claims. Always finish with the
`Human attention map` section — see § Human attention map. Do not stop
after the pre-PR report unless pre-PR findings are blocking (FAIL on
repo-wide invariants or verification); even then, run the confounder audit
and print the final `Human attention map` section after noting that the
ponytail-review pass and thermo-nuclear loop were skipped.

**Behavior:** report findings, do not auto-fix. List violations with
file:line citations.

## Consequential advice

Before recommending a consequential remediation or human-review priority,
follow the `Advice gate` in `dissenter`; report evidence-only findings
directly.
When the gate applies, first say that you are using `/dissenter` and why.

## Repo-wide invariants

These apply to any PR in any Syndeo-AI repo. Source of truth: top-level
`AGENTS.md` § Hard rules.

- No direct push to `main` in any repo. Branch + PR.
- Linear history required (rebase, no merge commits).
- A schema change is a backend-only PR; the frontend consumer PR lands
  separately, after.

## Per-sibling lint

Determine which siblings the PR touches (`git diff --name-only <base>`
and inspect the path prefixes). Run the relevant sub-checklists:

### backend/

- `errs.*` constructors only outside `internal/errs/` and tests. No
  direct `fmt.Errorf` or `errors.New` at call sites. Source:
  `backend/AGENTS.md` § Error handling.
- All tests use the table-driven pattern with `name`/`args`/`want`.
  Canonical shape: `internal/logger/logger_test.go`. Source:
  `backend/AGENTS.md` § Tests.
- `internal/logger` is the only sanctioned logger. No `fmt.Print*` or
  stdlib `log` for logging.
- Any new file under `backend/migrations/` passes
  `npx squawk-cli@2.51.0 -c .squawk.toml migrations/<file>.sql`. CI enforces
  this; a clean local run avoids surprises.

### frontend/

- JSX uses only `<div>` and `<span>`. No semantic HTML (`<p>`, `<h1>`,
  etc.). Source: `frontend/AGENTS.md` § JSX.
- Conditionals use ternary, not `&&`.
- Tailwind only — no inline styles or style objects.
- `const` only, never `let`. No mutations.
- Named params, not positional.
- `try/catch` over `.then/.catch`.
- `Item[]` not `Array<Item>`. `arr.length === 0` not `!arr`.
- No non-null assertions (`x!`); use `x as NonNullable<typeof x>`.
- No `../` relative imports — use `@resyndeo/web/*` or
  `@resyndeo/types/...`. Same-dir `./foo` ok.
- Don't fetch inside components — use a helper.
- Release-please config intact: `"component": "web"` and
  `"include-component-in-tag": true` in `release-please-config.json`.
  Changing either silently switches the tag pattern and orphans every
  prior release PR. Source: `frontend/AGENTS.md` § Releases.
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` is clean.
- `bun run quality:fallow` passes — the Fallow gate (dead-code, health,
  dupes, security). CI enforces this (`.github/workflows/fallow.yml`); a
  clean local run avoids surprises. An unavoidable hit is suppressed
  inline with `// fallow-ignore-next-line <rule>`, not by loosening the
  command.

### gitops/

- No real secrets in the repo. The in-repo `values.yaml` files contain
  non-secret config only; secrets layer in via the gitignored
  `~/.config/resyndeo-gitops/values.secret.yaml`. Source: `gitops/AGENTS.md`
  § Hard rules.
- `helm-eso-common` includes use `{{ include` (not `{{- include`) —
  PR #184 footgun. Source: `gitops/AGENTS.md` § Secret flow.
- No direct push to `main`, `dev`, or `prod` (branch protection
  enforces, but call it out in review). Source: `gitops/AGENTS.md`
  § Hard rules.
- Self-managed `helm-argocd/` changes have been tested locally with
  `helm template` before commit.

### infra/, terminal-ui/

Defer to that sibling's `AGENTS.md` (now auto-loaded once `CLAUDE.md`
is in place per the AGENTS.md context-loading framework spec).

## Cross-cutting verification

Before reporting clean:

- `make test` from the super-repo root passes.
- If the PR touches frontend, `cd frontend && bunx tsc --noEmit` and
  `cd frontend && bun run quality:fallow` are both clean.

## Run the complexity review

Say that you are using `ponytail-review` to inspect the branch for unnecessary
complexity.
Once the pre-PR checklist passes, invoke `ponytail-review` on the same
branch diff and print its normal output unchanged. This pass is report-only:
do not auto-fix its findings here, and do not block the
`thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` loop on them.

If the pre-PR report has blocking FAILs on repo-wide invariants or
verification steps, skip both `ponytail-review` and the thermo-nuclear
loop, then run the confounder audit and print the final `Human attention
map`.

## Loop the maintainability audit until clean

Say that you are using `loop` to repeat
`/thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` until the maintainability gate is clean.
`thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` is not a one-shot. Once the pre-PR
checklist and `ponytail-review` pass have run, drive the audit with the
`loop` skill in self-paced mode (`/loop` with no interval) so that each
iteration:

1. Re-runs `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` on the current branch
   changes.
2. Addresses **every** finding it surfaces — fix the code, or, for a
   finding you are deliberately waiving, record the explicit
   justification the audit's approval bar demands.
3. Repeats.

End the loop only when a full thermo-nuclear pass reports **zero**
remaining code-quality issues. Do not open the PR while any thermo-nuclear
finding is still unresolved — keep looping until the audit comes back
clean.

Regardless of the thermo-nuclear result, run the confounder audit next. If
the maintainability audit has unresolved findings because the loop could not
complete cleanly, continue with the confounder audit anyway.

## Audit changed claims

Say that you are using `confounder` to check the branch changes for conflated
concepts, missing bridges, and contradictions. Set its source explicitly to
the current branch diff against the PR base, including claims expressed by
changed documentation, specifications, tests, comments, names, interfaces,
and observable behavior. An earlier `unscramble` output counts only when it
covers this exact diff; otherwise let `confounder` run its claim-resolution
workflow for this source.

Include the resulting audit under a section titled exactly:

```markdown
## Confounder audit
```

Use the `confounder` skill's required claim citations, confidence,
explanation, and faithful repair. Write `None detected.` for an empty
conflation, missing-bridge, or contradiction category. This audit is
report-only: it neither modifies files nor blocks PR creation by itself.

After the confounder output, always finish with the `Human attention map`.
The map remains a separate risk signal and the final section of
`pre-pr-review`.

## Human attention map

At the very end of `pre-pr-review`, after the confounder audit, invoke an
explore agent to inspect the PR changes and produce a required Markdown
section titled exactly:

```markdown
## Human attention map
```

Purpose: help the PR author and GitHub reviewer distinguish ordinary
AI-generated edits from changed code sections that require careful human
review because mistakes could cause production outages, data loss or
corruption, security/auth regressions, billing or financial mistakes,
irreversible infrastructure changes, or similarly severe failures.

This report is required output only. It does not block PR creation or
merge by itself.

### Explore-agent scope

Give the explore agent a narrow brief:

- Review the branch diff against the PR base.
- Focus on changed files and enough nearby surrounding code to understand
  the changed section.
- Include enclosing function/component/resource context when useful.
- Do not broaden to the whole repo by default.
- Let the LLM make the final judgment about whether a changed section is
  critical.
- Flag only sections judged to be truly critical. Avoid "possible risk"
  or low-confidence noise.

### Report format

Always print the section.

If critical sections are found, use pasteable Markdown:

```markdown
## Human attention map

- `<file>` — `<function/component/resource/area>`, changed lines `<lines>`
  - Nearby context: `<short surrounding code snippet or enclosing context
    summary>`
  - Why this is critical: `<specific severe consequence>`
  - Human review focus: `<what the reviewer should inspect carefully>`
```

If no critical sections are identified:

```markdown
## Human attention map

No critical sections identified.
```

If the explore agent cannot inspect everything it needs to review, fail
closed without fake precision:

```markdown
## Human attention map

Incomplete: the explore agent could not inspect enough changed files and
nearby context to classify the critical sections confidently. The diff is
too large or insufficiently inspectable for this pass, so a human should
review the changed areas directly.
```

Do not mark every changed file as critical by default when exploration is
incomplete. State the incompleteness plainly.

## Output

Produce a checklist-style report:

```
## Pre-PR review

### Repo-wide invariants
- [PASS|FAIL] <invariant> — <evidence or finding>
...

### Per-sibling: backend/
...

### Verification
- [PASS|FAIL] make test — <evidence>
...

### Next step (automatic)
Running `ponytail-review`, then looping `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review`
(via the `loop` skill) until the maintainability audit comes back clean,
then running `confounder` on the branch changes.

## Confounder audit
<the confounder skill's claim status, conflations, missing bridges, and
contradictions for the branch changes>

## Human attention map
<critical sections, "No critical sections identified.", or incomplete notice>
```

Do not modify any files during the pre-PR checklist itself. If a violation
is fixable in one line, suggest the fix inline; do not apply it. Then,
unless this report has blocking FAILs on repo-wide invariants or
verification steps, run `ponytail-review` (§ Run the complexity review),
then hand off to the looped maintainability audit (§ Loop the
maintainability audit) without waiting for user confirmation — keep looping
`thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` until it comes back clean. After the
thermo-nuclear output, or after noting why the earlier review steps were
skipped, run the confounder audit (§ Audit changed claims), then print the
final `Human attention map`.
