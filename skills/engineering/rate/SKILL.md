Before scoring, say that you are using `/clean`, `/ddd`, and `/oop` as review
criteria. These are borrowed criteria, not child-skill invocations.

According to /branch, rate from 1 to 5 (5 means perfect, 1 means terrible) how much my code follows principles for each principle shown in:
## Bob Martin guidelines
/bob

## Clean code guidelines
/clean

## Domain driven design guidelines
/ddd

## Object oriented guidelines
/oop

## Idiomatic guidelines
/idiomatic

Also, make sure to explain each of the terminologies you are using.
